Jenkins defines extension points, which are interfaces or abstract classes that model an aspect of a build system.

Those interfaces define contracts of what need to be implemented, and Jenkins allows plugins to contribute
those implementations. In general, all you need to do to register an implementation is to mark it with
{{@Extension}}. Creating a new extension point is quite easy too,
see [defining a new extension point|JENKINS:Defining a new extension point] for details.

Currently the following extension points are available. See Javadoc for more details about the contracts:
